capshift v0.2 Alpha
Original by Foeh Mannay, January 2015
Current version by Niels Jakob Buch, February 2018

PURPOSE
=======

"capshift" is a tool which re-writes the timestamps of pcap files. This is useful when
you have two pcap files taken from different devices whose clocks are not synchronised
and you can't be bothered to repeatedly hand-correct the timestamps.

Please see http://networkingbodges.blogspot.com/ for more information on this if you 
are interested.

INSTALLATION
============

For Linux / Mac / MinGW it should be possible to build from source using:

gcc -o capshift capshift.c

USAGE
=====

There are only three parameters and all are mandatory. You must specify your
input capture file (original pcap format) with the -r flag, your output capture file
with the -w flag and your time offset with the -o flag. Here's an example:

./capshift -r original.cap -w shifted.cap -o +14.5

Parsing capfile, attempting to shift forward by 14.5s...
